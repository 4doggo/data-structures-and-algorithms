### Challenge 1
## Reversing the array without using builtin methods

- We went with using the forloop and the counter to go over the array

### Challenge 2 
## Inserting a value into the middle of an array 

- I approached it using multiple if statements for odd and even length arrays with a for loop going over it. 

- Not the most efficient but it works and it runs
